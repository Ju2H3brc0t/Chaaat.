# 🤖 Chaaat. - Documentation

## 🧩 Presentation

Originally designed for a single specific server, this bot is now capable of being on several different Discord servers thanks to a dedicated configuration system. This bot is hosted and maintained voluntarily by a single person in their free time, however you are free to take over the code or add the bot to your server.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🛠️ Technical features

#### 🔧 Dynamic configuration

 - Each server has a dedicated configuration folder: 
 `server_configs/<guild_id>/config.yaml`

 - The `config.yaml` file contains the configuration of the various features.

 - A slash command (`/set_config`) allows you to modify your server configuration.

 - A command (`/config show`) allows you to display the current configuration in a readable embed.

#### 💾 Data storage

 - Server-specific data (like score counting) is stored in `server_configs/<guild_id>/data.json`.

 - Automatic read/write at each affected event.

### 🎮 Practical features

- A counting feature allows members to take turns counting in a specific channel.
- The bot:
    - verifies that the numerical sequence is correct,
    - prevents duplicate messages from the same user,
    - saves progress in `data.json`.
